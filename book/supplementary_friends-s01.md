Supplementary friends-s01
=========================

This section includes a few extra analyses we implemented to select the hyperparameters `cluster`, `state` and `fwhm` to generate DYPAC parcellations. These include:
 * Matching parcels spatially between the training and validation subsets of `friends-s01`, to inspect qualitatively the parcels. This was done separately for `cluster-20_state-60`, and `cluster-300-state-900`.
 * Visualize brain maps of explained R2 in the brain for the validation subset of `friends-s01`, using DYPAC parcellations generated with the training subset, as well as public group parcellations. This motivated generating summary of the R2 distribution for the cortex, central structures and cerebellum. 
 * Summary statistics for R2 distributions in the preceding experiment, only in central structures, and only in the cerebellum. Summary R2 measures for the cortex are presented in the main paper.

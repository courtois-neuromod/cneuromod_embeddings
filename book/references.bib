  abstract = "Population imaging markedly increased the size of
              functional-imaging datasets, shedding new light on the neural
              basis of inter-individual differences. Analyzing these large data
              entails new scalability challenges, computational and
              statistical. For this reason, brain images are typically
              summarized in a few signals, for instance reducing voxel-level
              measures with brain atlases or functional modes. A good choice of
              the corresponding brain networks is important, as most data
              analyses start from these reduced signals. We contribute
              finely-resolved atlases of functional modes, comprising from 64
              to 1024 networks. These dictionaries of functional modes (DiFuMo)
              are trained on millions of fMRI functional brain volumes of total
              size 2.4 ​TB, spanned over 27 studies and many research groups.
              We demonstrate the benefits of extracting reduced signals on our
              fine-grain atlases for many classic functional data analysis
              pipelines: stimuli decoding from 12,334 brain responses, standard
              GLM analysis of fMRI across sessions and individuals, extraction
              of resting-state functional-connectomes biomarkers for 2500
              individuals, data compression and meta-analysis over more than
              15,000 statistical maps. In each of these analysis scenarii, we
              compare the performance of our functional atlases with that of
              other popular references, and to a simple voxel-level analysis.
              Results highlight the importance of using high-dimensional
              ``soft'' functional atlases, to represent and analyze brain
              activity while capturing its functional gradients. Analyses on
              high-dimensional modes achieve similar statistical performance as
              at the voxel level, but with much reduced computational cost and
              higher interpretability. In addition to making them available, we
              provide meaningful names for these modes, based on their
              anatomical location. It will facilitate reporting of results.",

              networks, exist whether or not they are functionally active at
              any given moment. However, it is not known to what extent brain
              regions are continuously interacting when the brain is ``at
              rest.'' In this work, we identify the major explicit activation
              networks by carrying out an image-based activation network
              analysis of thousands of separate activation maps derived from
              the BrainMap database of functional imaging studies, involving
              nearly 30,000 human subjects. Independently, we extract the major
              covarying networks in the resting brain, as imaged with
              functional magnetic resonance imaging in 36 subjects at rest. The
              sets of major brain networks, and their decompositions into
              subnetworks, show close correspondence between the independent
              analyses of resting and activation brain dynamics. We conclude
              that the full repertoire of functional networks utilized by the
              brain in action is continuously and dynamically ``active'' even
              when at ``rest.''",

  abstract = "A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the
              cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological ``atoms''.
              Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
              offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation.
              Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches.
              The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in
              functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially
              reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or
              visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach
              clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of
              spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous
              (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted
              Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and
              global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across
              diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be
              more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations.
              Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of
              certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic
              fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic)
              features that likely reflect distinct computational units within
              known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF
              parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of
              brain organization and are potentially useful for future
              applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise
              fMRI data. Multiresolution parcellations generated from 1489

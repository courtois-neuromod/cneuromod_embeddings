              representing and understanding all connections within the brain
              as a network, while the subdivision of the brain into interacting
              functional units is inherent in its architecture. As a result,
              the definition of network nodes is one of the most critical steps
              in connectivity network analysis. Although brain atlases obtained
              from cytoarchitecture or anatomy have long been used for this
              task, connectivity-driven methods have arisen only recently,
              aiming to delineate more homogeneous and functionally coherent
              regions. This study provides a systematic comparison between
              anatomical, connectivity-driven and random parcellation methods

              investigated in the literature, we evaluate 10 subject-level and

              assess the accuracy of parcellations from four different aspects:

               vivo mapping of functional networks in the brain, referred to as
               intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Despite a burgeoning
               literature, researchers continue to struggle with the challenge
               of defining computationally efficient and reliable approaches
               for identifying and characterizing ICNs. Independent component
               analysis (ICA) has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring ICNs
               in both healthy and clinical populations. In particular,
               temporal concatenation group ICA (TC-GICA) coupled with a
               back-reconstruction step produces participant-level resting
               state functional connectivity maps for each group-level
               component. The present work systematically evaluated the
               test--retest reliability of TC-GICA derived RSFC measures over
               the short-term (<45 min) and long-term (5--16 months).
               Additionally, to investigate the degree to which the components
               revealed by TC-GICA are detectable via single-session ICA, we
               investigated the reproducibility of TC-GICA findings. First, we
               found moderate-to-high short- and long-term test--retest
               reliability for ICNs derived by combining TC-GICA and dual
               regression. Exceptions to this finding were limited to
               physiological- and imaging-related artifacts. Second, our
               reproducibility analyses revealed notable limitations for
               template matching procedures to accurately detect TC-GICA based
               components at the individual scan level. Third, we found that
               TC-GICA component's reliability and reproducibility ranks are
               highly consistent. In summary, TC-GICA combined with dual

              Here, we propose a pipeline based on the priori-driven

              estimating brain functional network measures from functional

              accurate and unbiased representations of functional data
              essential for interpreting any downstream analyses. Here, we
              extend the framework of probabilistic functional modes (PFMs)
              (Harrison et al., 2015) to capture cross-subject variability not
              only in the mode spatial maps, but also in the functional
              coupling between modes and in mode amplitudes. A new
              implementation of the inference now also allows for the analysis
              of modern, large-scale data sets, and the combined inference and
              analysis package, PROFUMO, is available from

              subjects collected as part of the Human Connectome Project (Van
              Essen et al., 2013), and an analysis of 14 subjects in a variety
              of continuous task-states (Kieliba et al., 2019), we demonstrate
              how PFMs are able to capture, within a single model, a rich
              description of how the spatio-temporal structure of resting-state
              fMRI activity varies across subjects. We also compare the new PFM
              model to the well established independent component analysis with
              dual regression (ICA-DR) pipeline. This reveals that, under PFM
              assumptions, much more of the (behaviorally relevant)
              cross-subject variability in fMRI activity should be attributed
              to the variability in spatial maps, and that, after accounting
              for this, functional coupling between modes primarily reflects
              current cognitive state. This has fundamental implications for
              the interpretation of cross-sectional studies of functional

               resting-state networks. Several studies on resting fMRI have
               been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the

              function from fMRI data frequently require the specification of
              regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on
              atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries
              to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting
              state functional connectivity (FC) studies has yet to be
              established. This article introduces a data-driven method for
              generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state
              fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous FC.
              Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological
              trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters.
              Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation
              atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux,
              Harvard-Oxford, Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical
              Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated
              anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not
              accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the voxel scale. In
              general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform
              equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and
              hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest
              impact on their suitability for FC analysis. With 200 or fewer
              ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic
              homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation
              results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most
              accurately represent FC patterns present at the voxel scale and
              are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for
              accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering software have been

              generally related to anatomical distance by an inverse square

    abstract = { Data-driven parcellations are widely used for exploring the functional organization of the brain, and also for reducing the high dimensionality of fMRI data. Despite the flurry of methods proposed in the literature, functional brain parcellations are not highly reproducible at the level of individual subjects, even with very long acquisitions. Some brain areas are also more difficult to parcellate than others, with association heteromodal cortices being the most challenging. An important limitation of classical parcellations is that they are static, that is, they neglect dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks. In this paper, we proposed a new method to identify dynamic states of parcellations, which we hypothesized would improve reproducibility over static parcellation approaches. For a series of seed voxels in the brain, we applied a cluster analysis to regroup short (3 min) time windows into “states” with highly similar seed parcels. We splitted individual time series of the Midnight scan club sample into two independent sets of 2.5 hr (test and retest). We found that average within-state parcellations, called stability maps, were highly reproducible (over 0.9 test-retest spatial correlation in many instances) and subject specific (fingerprinting accuracy over 70\% on average) between test and retest. Consistent with our hypothesis, seeds in heteromodal cortices (posterior and anterior cingulate) showed a richer repertoire of states than unimodal (visual) cortex. Taken together, our results indicate that static functional parcellations are incorrectly averaging well-defined and distinct dynamic states of brain parcellations. This work calls to revisit previous methods based on static parcellations, which includes the majority of published network analyses of fMRI data. Our method may, thus, impact how researchers model the rich interactions between brain networks in health and disease. }

  abstract = "A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the
              cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological ``atoms''.
              Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
              offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation.
              Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches.
              The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in
              functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially
              reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or
              visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach
              clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of
              spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous
              (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted
              Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and
              global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across
              diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be
              more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations.
              Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of
              certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic
              fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic)
              features that likely reflect distinct computational units within
              known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF
              parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of
              brain organization and are potentially useful for future
              applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise
              fMRI data. Multiresolution parcellations generated from 1489
              participants are publicly available

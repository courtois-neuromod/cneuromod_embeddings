  abstract = "The goal of human brain mapping has long been to delineate the
              functional subunits in the brain and elucidate the functional
              role of each of these brain regions. Recent work has focused on
              whole-brain parcellation of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
              (fMRI) data to identify these subunits and create a functional
              atlas. Functional connectivity approaches to understand the brain
              at the network level require such an atlas to assess connections
              between parcels and extract network properties. While no single
              functional atlas has emerged as the dominant atlas to date, there
              remains an underlying assumption that such an atlas exists. Using
              fMRI data from a highly sampled subject as well as two
              independent replication data sets, we demonstrate that functional
              parcellations based on fMRI connectivity data reconfigure
              substantially and in a meaningful manner, according to brain
              state.",

    abstract = { Data-driven parcellations are widely used for exploring the functional organization of the brain, and also for reducing the high dimensionality of fMRI data. Despite the flurry of methods proposed in the literature, functional brain parcellations are not highly reproducible at the level of individual subjects, even with very long acquisitions. Some brain areas are also more difficult to parcellate than others, with association heteromodal cortices being the most challenging. An important limitation of classical parcellations is that they are static, that is, they neglect dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks. In this paper, we proposed a new method to identify dynamic states of parcellations, which we hypothesized would improve reproducibility over static parcellation approaches. For a series of seed voxels in the brain, we applied a cluster analysis to regroup short (3 min) time windows into “states” with highly similar seed parcels. We splitted individual time series of the Midnight scan club sample into two independent sets of 2.5 hr (test and retest). We found that average within-state parcellations, called stability maps, were highly reproducible (over 0.9 test-retest spatial correlation in many instances) and subject specific (fingerprinting accuracy over 70\% on average) between test and retest. Consistent with our hypothesis, seeds in heteromodal cortices (posterior and anterior cingulate) showed a richer repertoire of states than unimodal (visual) cortex. Taken together, our results indicate that static functional parcellations are incorrectly averaging well-defined and distinct dynamic states of brain parcellations. This work calls to revisit previous methods based on static parcellations, which includes the majority of published network analyses of fMRI data. Our method may, thus, impact how researchers model the rich interactions between brain networks in health and disease. }

              entails new scalability challenges, computational and
              statistical. For this reason, brain images are typically
              summarized in a few signals, for instance reducing voxel-level
              measures with brain atlases or functional modes. A good choice of
              the corresponding brain networks is important, as most data
              analyses start from these reduced signals. We contribute
              finely-resolved atlases of functional modes, comprising from 64
              to 1024 networks. These dictionaries of functional modes (DiFuMo)
              are trained on millions of fMRI functional brain volumes of total
              size 2.4 ​TB, spanned over 27 studies and many research groups.
              We demonstrate the benefits of extracting reduced signals on our
              fine-grain atlases for many classic functional data analysis
              pipelines: stimuli decoding from 12,334 brain responses, standard
              GLM analysis of fMRI across sessions and individuals, extraction
              of resting-state functional-connectomes biomarkers for 2500
              individuals, data compression and meta-analysis over more than
              15,000 statistical maps. In each of these analysis scenarii, we
              compare the performance of our functional atlases with that of
              other popular references, and to a simple voxel-level analysis.
              Results highlight the importance of using high-dimensional
              ``soft'' functional atlases, to represent and analyze brain
              activity while capturing its functional gradients. Analyses on
              high-dimensional modes achieve similar statistical performance as
              at the voxel level, but with much reduced computational cost and
              higher interpretability. In addition to making them available, we

              anatomical location. It will facilitate reporting of results.",

              Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
              offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation.
              Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches.
              The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in
              functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially
              reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or
              visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach
              clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of
              spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous
              (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted
              Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and
              global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across
              diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be
              more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations.
              Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of
              certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic
              fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic)
              features that likely reflect distinct computational units within
              known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF
              parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of
              brain organization and are potentially useful for future
              applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise

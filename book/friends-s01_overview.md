Hyper-parameter selection
=========================

We first implemented a series of experiments to explore the impact of different parameters on the quality of embeddings in the `friends-s01` dataset. We ordered all fMRI runs for each subject by chronological order, and separated the `even` runs (training data) from the `odd` runs (validation data). We generated several dynamic parcellations using dypac independently on `friends-s01` training and validation datasets.
